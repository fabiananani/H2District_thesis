**Title**
Impact of performance degradation on the optimal design of hydrogen systems

**Abstract**
This work proposes a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) designed to optimize both the size and operation of the components in a power generation site, including a hydrogen-fed PEM fuel cell (PEMFC), with the goal of minimizing costs. The model explores a method to analyze the impact of fuel cell degradation on the optimization results. Three different degradation models, which account for degradation in terms of performance decline, are investigated to assess the nonlinearities that arise when incorporating each model into the MILP framework.(to be continued) 

**Installation**
In order to run the optimization, MATLAB (including the optimization toolbox) and Gurobi should be installed.
